# DIY-Macropad
Using a Pro Micro microcontroller and the Arduino IDE. Created a simple 9-key Macropad with a 3D-Printed case custom made in AutoDesk Fusion 360. The 9 keys are programmed to
open applications quicker and set up my desktop into my preferred layout. However, with some simple C++ coding the keys can be programmed do anyhting the user wishes.
